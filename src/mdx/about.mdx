I am a musician, professional developer, and educator.
My path into software engineering wasn't linear, and on the way I was not only a teacher (bicycle mechanics, English as a Second Language, middle-school social studies, programming mentor) but as an engineer with a fastener (screw) manufacturer and a paralegal in a public benefits legal aid organization. _For me personally_ programming made sense. I find it intellectually and creatively stimulating.

On a deeper level I'm a socialist who cares passionately about the linked struggles for racial, economic and ecological justice and try to balance this with my professional life.

I do have some other hobbies:

- Rock climbing
- Aikido
- Longboarding (on wheels)
- Cooking & baking
- Music

I live in United States with my partner and cats.
I keep most social media pretty locked down but you can find me on <Link external href="https://linkedin.com/in/erikdstock">linkedin</Link>.

#### About this blog:

I forked [John Polacek](http://johnpolacek.com/)'s <Link external href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js</Link> blog starter to build this.
You can view and fork a starter based on my stack (which primarily adds typescript to the original) <Link external href="https://nextjs-mdx-themeui-ts-starter.erikdstock.vercel.app" >here</Link>.
