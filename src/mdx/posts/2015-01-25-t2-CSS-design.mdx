title: "Block? Inline? ...or maybe inline-block?"

  As someone new to web design it is easy to get hung up on its most
  recognizably strange aspects: Memorizing code and syntax, being conscious of
  things like indentations and commenting and the like. Having mastered the
  entire process of typing an anchor tag (to make a link- I guess it isn't
  called an "a" tag) I coasted into the second half of this week ready to slap
  my first website together from scratch. And then... things come grinding to a
  halt. I doubt I'm the first. It had nothing to do with syntax. This was about
  positioning.
</p>
<p>
  I was struggling to make my header and navigation elements nest together
  comfortably at most reasonable screen resolutions. I had already mapped it out
  in my head, had a pretty good idea of how I'd do it (lots of divs), so it was
  mostly going to be a challenge of typing all the div tags out without making a
  mistake. Checking in on my work the first time in a browser, it was a complete
  mess. Things piled up on top of each other, not respecting the dimensions I'd
  set, I didn't even know where to start finding answers.
</p>
<p>
  The fact is that there are a LOT of different elements and attributes and
  properties. When <em>I</em> think about positioning (so far) I have been
  focused on static vs. relative vs. absolute vs. fixed - maybe something about
  floats at times. I've tended to overlook the importance of the{" "}
  <strong>display</strong> property. However, understanding some of its quirks
  can go a long way towards other confusing positioning problems.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Block</em> elements are probably the easiest to recognize for someone who
  is brand new to writing html. They are the most visible because we can tell
  them how much space to take up: an block element can have its width and height
  set, which is probably the reason I think of the div as a box. Importantly,
  block elements also automatically create a new line- this is why we use the{" "}
  <em>float</em> property to place divs horizontally next to each other when we
  don't want them to stack.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Inline</em> elements are just the opposite. Their dimensions are limited
  to what they contain and they can't be set otherwise; they don't create a new
  line, but rather sit together in a line.
</p>
<p>
  Inline display gives us a much greater control and new ways to arrange
  elements on a page, but what if we still want to control our element like a
  block- to set it height, for example? By entering the property
  display:inline-block we can do just that. <em>Inline-block</em> elements flow
  from left to right across the page, making them easy to stack for a horizontal
  nav, a grid of photos, etc. They can be manipulated with properties like
  height, width and vertical-align.

  goes much deeper into this topic, especially comparing the advantages and
  quirks of the inline-block display property to those of floats. Each has its
  own alignment solutions, its own workarounds. Inline-block elements tend to
  create a tiny whitespace next to each other, floats tend to collapse their
  container boxes and need an overflow:auto property set to prevent it. And
  there is more.
</p>
<p>
  As a new developer, these nuances are something that I know I will only pick
  up through practice and repetition and asking for help again and again. At the
  same time, I've worked through and implemented solutions that use{" "}
  <em>display</em> in contradictory ways on different parts of my site. Like{" "}
  <em>position</em> this is a distinction worth knowing and taking the time to
  learn intentionally- rather than through osmosis.
