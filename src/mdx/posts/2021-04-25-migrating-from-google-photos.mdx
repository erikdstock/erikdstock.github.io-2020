  I spent years convincing my friends to put all their pictures on Google Photos. With this post I repay a debt to them.

Around a decade ago - my early smartphone days - I realized that pictures were beginning to build up on my computer at an unmanageable rate. Compared to less than 300 surviving images from my college years' digital camera I was now adding thousands of new pictures and videos every year (few keepers but that is a different issue). On top of this I was jumping from one cheap computer to the next at this time, often swapping out multiple operating systems in between. During this time I experimented with many schemes and software for managing my photo and music collections. On reflection, it's clear that this has become a preoccupation that will probably last the rest of my life.

Google's free cloud storage for photos and music was a breakthrough for me. Overnight I was able to move my Picasa albums online and access pictures going all the way back to January 1, 2001 (really wish I could travel back in time and set my camera's date) from anywhere. The, because I'm also one of those helpful friends that can always tell you which app is going to fix some problem you haven't noticed yet, I began getting all of them to move over to it.

Google's "search, don't sort" philosophy and unlimited "compressed, high-quality" storage was a perfect fit for an ever-expanding collection of pictures: A place to automatically dump and never think or worry about them again. No more worrying about my phone's storage space or deleting the bad photos. I was less concerned about their business model (predicated on mining user data), shady privacy practices or corporate power at this time, and there were no alternatives offering free, unlimited storage without the need to worry about organizing files. The landscape is much different today, and early in the pandemic I finally got bored enough to exit the service permanently.

Apple's iCloud photos fit my needs. I say this fully aware that Apple and Alphabet are equally huge and, compared to me, evil. But the facts are that:

- I am predominantly an Apple user, largely for reasons of convenience
- iCloud's photos are accessible as files- I can download them all any time I want
- I generally take the Apple corporation seriously when they point out their business model does not rely on exploiting user data the way Alphabet does
- The Photos app on both iOS and MacOS is very performant compared to a decade ago, handling my 100gb library without a stutter.

These were my calculations, and maybe they are relevant to you as well. If so, I'll briefly outline my process, honed over the past 10 months, in making this migration.
